jnrdev-js
---------

A JavaScript-based recreation of the old jnrdev tutorials by Florian Hufsky, with some modifications. It is a faily simple tile-based implementation of the SAT (separating axis theorem) with rectangles.

This project deviates from the original tutorials because ultimately my goal is to make collision detection and response more modular, and I wanted to make the code a bit more generic.
