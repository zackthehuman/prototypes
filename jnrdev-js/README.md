jnrdev-js
---------

A JavaScript-based recreation of the old jnrdev tutorials by Florian Hufsky, with some modifications. It is a simple tile-based implementation of AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) collision detection and response.

This project deviates from the original tutorials because ultimately my goal is to make collision detection and response more modular, and I wanted to make the code a bit more generic. We'll see if it gets there...
